        <p>Choosing which college to go to can be stressful for many young adults. Many students face the difficulty of choosing where they will go for college, in hopes that making the right decision will lead them to success after graduation. Black students have a tough decision not just on choosing where to go, but if they want to go to a predominantly white institution or a historically Black college or university.</p>

        <p>There are multiple factors that students have to consider when choosing if they want to go to a PWI or a HBCU including financial aid, networking opportunities and being around other students who share the same culture and experiences.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="blog-post">
        <p>Many students choose PWIs because they offer financial aid and scholarships that also are minority-specific. PWIs also are likely to be publicly funded as many of them are state-schools while many HBCUs are underfunded in comparison.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-post">
              <p>According to the college board, students at Howard University receive an average aid package of $25,000. After four years, tuition costs up to $250,000 not including financial aid. Tuition by school varies among HBCUs even among the more popular HBCUs.</p></div>

   <p>University of Maryland alumnus, Isaiah Hayes thought about attending an hbcu. Hayes grew up in Baltimore and said that he grew up in a majority Black environment. Although he grew up near Morgan State University, he decided to go to UMD.</p>
      </div>

       <div class="blog-post">
        <p>Hayes said that before college he wanted to attend Morgan State University, Howard University and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. He received more money from UMD and thought that the university was a better choice to be a journalism major. Hayes said that he applied to Howard University but they offered him approximately $4,000 over four years.</p>

        <p>At UMD he experienced some discomfort because of his race and said that it was easy to be overlooked because the school was competitive. Hayes said that some professors overlooked some Black publications and did not see those publications as professional as majority white staffed publications.</p>

        <p>Hayes also stated that despite choosing a PWI many hbcu students receive opportunities because they are at an hbcu. He said that he wished the same opportunities were given to Black students at PWIs.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-post">
        <p>“I do wish those same opportunities were directed to Black people at PWIs specifically, and not just Black people at HBCUs. I think the support from the outside world is still needed and just not given as much as it is at hbcus,” Hayes said.</p>

        <p>Peterrene Mator attended the University of Arizona but spent most of her upbringing in Illinois where she was surrounded by other people of color. She decided to attend the University of Arizona rather than an HBCU because she preferred Arizona as a state. She also said that because of her upbringing, she did not feel the need to go to college in a predominantly Black environment.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="blog-post">
        <p>“that was what was different for me, like I have never been around a bunch of white people in my life and I kind of just wanted the opposite of everything of what I grew up around.” Mator said.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="blog-post">
        <p>70% of first year students at the university are white, while Black students make up over 8%. Mator said although there are some cultural aspects that she feels like she missed by attending a PWI she does not think those experiences would have changed her choice of going to a PWI.</p>
